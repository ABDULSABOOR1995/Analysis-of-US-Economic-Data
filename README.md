# Analysis of US Economic Data & Building Dashboard Using Python
 ## Overview:
Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this assignment, we will extract some essential economic indicators from some data and then display these economic indicators in a Dashboard. We can then share the dashboard via a URL.

<b>Gross domestic product (GDP)</b> is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less; similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better. In this project, we will examine how changes in GDP impact the unemployment rate by using data visualizations such as Line and Bar Charts or by finding a correlation between GDP & unemployment rate.

## Explanation:
Now we explain every step of our project in detail with screenshots.

### 1. Data Collection: 
First of all, we collect data from the given source. Since this project belongs to <b> Coursera Project</b>, So we use link provided by Coursera to read both csv files(gdp & unemployment).
